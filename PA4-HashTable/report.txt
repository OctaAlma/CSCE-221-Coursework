2. Regarding inheritance, what are pure virtual functions?

Pure virtual functions are functions in a base class that do NOT have any defined behaviors, and
it is up to the derived classes to provide the definitions.


3. What are your observations on the runtime of the different hash table methods?

After running each runner 8 times, I gathered the following runtimes (in microseconds):

  Trial | Chaining | Probing
________|__________|___________
Trial 1 | 455326   |   855691 |
Trial 2 | 463359   |   879297 |
Trial 3 | 465617   |   867906 |
Trial 4 | 455431   |   862734 |
Trial 5 | 467267   |   912121 |
Trial 6 | 461552   |   873953 |
Trial 7 | 457064   |   932431 |
Trial 8 | 468341   |   866879 |

Overall, it appears that the chaining hash table has better performance to that 
of the probing hash table when it comes to the data in our dictionary. 

4. We did an extremely simplified blockchain and cryptocurrency, using the requirement that the hash only needs to begin with '2'.  What mining approach did you create to try to find a valid nonce?

The mining function was very brute-force. The mining function actually takes the previous block's hash, converts it into a string, and applies 
the PRH24 hash that we made. It repeats this process with the previous hash it created until it gets a valid hash that begins with '2'.


5. How might you approach this problem differently with a more restrictive problem?  For instance, if you change the validator to require the hash begin with "221", you will find the mining operation takes significantly more time.  Briefly discuss this in the context of modern cryptocurrency mining.

In the case that the hash had to start with "221", I would probably have to use my knowledge of the hash function and signing process to better optimize 
the mining algorithm. In modern cryptocurrency mining, obtaining a valid hash requires a lot of computational and physical resources, due to the brute-force nature
of the mining and different validator conditions.
